		<p>Notes</p><br>
		<p>For the design I have tried many different colors but was not able to find what I want. So I decided to stick with a simple black and white color and add animations later on using javascript for project 3</p>

		<br>
		<p>I added a multipage system in the main page. I was unable to figure out how to also add mouse scroll button. I am planning to make gallery slides for the other work pages</p>

		<p>Difficulties</p>
		<p>- I had difficulties in making the drop down menu. Placing the menus to the center and placing the whole menu unto the center</p>
		<p>- For my 3D models I was trying to record a video of them animating but the lab computers did not allow me to use the camera. (Need to figure it out for project 3)</p>
		<p>- At first the navigation bar was shown behind the images after I added the jquery slideshow. It took some time to figure out where to put the z-index</p>
		<p>- The mouse scroll is a bit too sensitive</p>
		<p>- For the image slides after I put it into Banjo there are some errors that worked fine at first. I need to click on the link (through nav bar) two times to actually get it working.
			At first it won't show the image but when I click on the link again it shows.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Above and Beyond</p>
		<p>- The well made drop down menu that I am so proud of myself</p>
		<p>- Added a mouse scroll and button function for the main page so that it can toggle through different projects</p>
		<br>
		<p>For the codes I looked at the demos we went through in class</p><br>
