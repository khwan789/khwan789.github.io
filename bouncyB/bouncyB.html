                <h2>Bouncy Blast</h2><br>
                <p>Bouncy Blast is a mixture of a puzzle game and a brick breaker game.
                    <br>1000~5000 Downloads.</p><br>
                
                <p>Bitmango - Puzzle Game Company Intern <br>June, 2017 ~ August, 2017</p><br>
                
                <p>I worked in a group of two, along with a developer, making prototype games at Bitmango.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2><br>
                
                <p>Try to break as many bricks as possible before it reaches the ground. Tap two or more connected blocks in order to fire.</p><br>
                <h2>Experience</h2><br>
                <p>Brick breaking games such as BBTAN, Ballz, and different bricks breaker were very popular at the time. We, as a team, wanted to incorporate puzzle game play style into the brick breaking game.</p><br>
                <p>Balanced the number of tiles for both the puzzle and bricks. Decided to decrease the tile sizes for the puzzle so that we can fit in more and spare the satisfaction of destroying many tiles at once.<br><br>For the gameplay we started off with players clicking on the puzzle and click again to decide the angle to fire the bullets. However, the play speed was too slow and boring so we changed to deciding the fire position and angle as soon as the player clicks on the tiles.</p>
