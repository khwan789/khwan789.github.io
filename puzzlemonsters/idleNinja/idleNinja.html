                <p>Idle Ninja Online is a mobile RPG currently available on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. <br>As ninjas, players must grow strong to defeat the monsters that terrorize the villagers and the world. <br>I contributed as a Game Designer from the very beginning of development. <br>I designed systems, levels, content, and much more in the early stages of the development. <br>As the company grew, I mainly focused on content and event design.</p>

                <p>• Ninjas throw shurikens and activate skills to damage the enemies. 
                <br>• Ninjas can equip up to 5 shurikens based on their preferred combinations.
                <br>• I have contributed to designing the shurikens, from concept to skill mechanics.
                <br>• Worked with artists, programmers, and others to bring powerful shurikens live to the ninjas.
