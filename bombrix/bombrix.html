                <p>Bombrix is a mobile puzzle game that is currently up on Google Play. <br>10,000~50,000 Downloads.</p><br>
                
                <p>Bitmango - Intern Game Designer 
                    <br>June, 2017 ~ August, 2017</p><br>
                
                <p>I worked in a group of two, along with a developer, making prototype games at Bitmango.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2><br>
                
                <p>Clear the board by dropping the brick(s) to the right place. Three or more, same touching blocks, explodes!! Figure out a way to destroy all the bricks at once.</p>
                
                <br>
                <h2>Experience</h2><br>
                <p>As a game designer I outlined and documented the whole game on Google Slides and Sheets. Slides were used for the design document and Sheets were used for level designing. The developer I worked with created a level generator on Unity and I designed total of 300 levels for the puzzle mode. Eventually, 240 levels were used and 60 were kept on hold. I also worked on balancing the arcade mode on Google Sheets as well.<br><br>In order to continuously get ahold of the player's interest the difficulty should not increase linearly. There needs to be a blance of increase and decrease as shown on the example below. (graph made from excel and saved as png) </p><br>
                <img src="graph.png"><br>
                <p>I made an equation to calculate the difficulty of the levels and assigned the orders so that the difficulty of the game can slowly rise similarly to the graph above.<br><br>For the player to have fun in a game with levels of this sort, the player must feel a sense of improvement. Levels 1~3 challenges the player and level 4 eases the player. It allows the player to take a break while still playing the game as well as believing that he/she got better at the game. Making the difficulty to increase linearly can stress out the player and decrease satisfaction, most likely to quit the game on early stage of gameplay.</p><br>
                <h3>Difficulties</h3><br>
                <p> Since we did not have any artist it was extra difficult working on the art. We started off with purchasing and downloading free assets online, however ended up with a disorented looking product. After communicating with designers and artists from different teams we decided to go for a simple design. We benchmarked different games such as 'Bejeweled', 'Flowfree', and other Bitmango games to finish up the project with simple shapes and colors.</p>
