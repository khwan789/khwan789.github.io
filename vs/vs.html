                <h3>Always start with a design document**</h3><br>
                <p>Versus Sketches is a shoot 'em up game that I've made using Unity as a personal project.<br><br>Started off planning on making a simple game so I decided to skip the process of making a design document, which was a very dumb decision. The project took a month to finish, which could've been done much earlier if I had it organized. Eventually, I had to get rid of all unnecessary ideas and assets and focus more on 'simplicity' as I have planned at the beginning.<br><br> 
                    I took my time on deciding the line between what is simple and what is unfinished. Possible future addtions are 'pause in game' and a 'popup to ask if player wants to exit game'. All artwork was done in Inkscape and since I am not a great artist I decided to go with the theme of sketches.<br><br>
