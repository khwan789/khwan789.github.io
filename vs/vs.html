                <p>Versus Sketches is a shoot 'em up game that I've made using Unity as a personal project. <br>I tried to focus on making a "simple" game and really took my time on deciding the line between what is simple and what is unfinished. 
                    <br>All artwork was done in Inkscape and since I am not a great artist I decided to go with the theme of sketches. I am planning on making a few additional casual games as a 'Versus Series' in the future using the same theme.
